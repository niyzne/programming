### For Loop

The `for` loop works like in Python. (Called a foreach loop in some languages, not to be confused with the C-style for loop, which is a different thing).

```python
for i in sequence:
	#do something with i
```

Similar to the `while` loop, the `for` loop also repeatedly calls a block of code. Instead of looping based on a condition, it executes the loop body once for each element in a sequence.

#### Syntax

A for loop looks like this:

```python
for variable_name in sequence:
	#code block
```

variable_name can be any name you choose. It is a variable that stores the current element in the sequence. sequence needs to be some value that can be iterated like a range of numbers. The code block is executed for every element with the loop variable assigned to that element.

#### Sequences

`Ranges`

#### Example
```python
for i in range(5):
    harvest()
```

This loop executes the body a fixed number of times. It is essentially the same as writing

```python
i = 0
harvest()
i = 1
harvest()
i = 2
harvest()
i = 3
harvest()
i = 4
harvest()
```

So it calls `harvest()` 5 times.
