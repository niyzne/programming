# Is this a triangle?

---
## Info

Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

Examples:

```
Input -> Output
1,2,2 -> true
4,2,3 -> true
2,2,2 -> true
1,2,3 -> false
-5,1,3 -> false
0,2,3 -> false
1,2,9 -> false 
```

## Code

Solution

```python
def is_triangle(a, b, c):
    return False
```

Sample Tests

```python
import codewars_test as test
from solution import is_triangle

@test.describe("Fixed Tests")
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_test_cases():
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, 2, 2), True, "didn't work when sides were 1, 2, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(7, 2, 2), False, "didn't work when sides were 7, 2, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, 2, 3), False, "didn't work when sides were 1, 2, 3")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, 3, 2), False, "didn't work when sides were 1, 3, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(3, 1, 2), False, "didn't work when sides were 3, 1, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(5, 1, 2), False, "didn't work when sides were 5, 1, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, 2, 5), False, "didn't work when sides were 1, 2, 5")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(2, 5, 1), False, "didn't work when sides were 2, 5, 1")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(4, 2, 3), True, "didn't work when sides were 4, 2, 3")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(5, 1, 5), True, "didn't work when sides were 5, 1, 5")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(2, 2, 2), True, "didn't work when sides were 2, 2, 2")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(-1, 2, 3), False, "didn't work when sides were -1, 2, 3")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, -2, 3), False, "didn't work when sides were 1, -2, 3")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(1, 2, -3), False, "didn't work when sides were 1, 2, -3")
        test.assert_equals(is_triangle(0, 2, 3), False, "didn't work when sides were 0, 2, 3")
```

## Code Solution

```python
def is_triangle(a, b, c):
    if a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0: 
        if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
            return True
    return False
```
