# Sum of the first nth term of Series

---
## Task

Your task is to write a function which returns the `n`-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence (`n` is the input parameter).

Series:1+14+17+110+113+116+…\mathrm{Series:}\quad 1 + \frac14 + \frac17 + \frac1{10} + \frac1{13} + \frac1{16} + \dotsSeries:1+41​+71​+101​+131​+161​+…

You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.
## Rules

- You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.
- If the given value is `0` then it should return `"0.00"`.
- You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.
## Examples (Input --> Output)

```
n
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"
```

## Code

Solution

```python
def series_sum(n):
    # Happy Coding ^_^
```

Sample Tests

```python
import codewars_test as test
from solution import series_sum

@test.describe("Fixed Tests")
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_test_cases():
        test.assert_equals(series_sum(1), "1.00")
        test.assert_equals(series_sum(2), "1.25")
        test.assert_equals(series_sum(3), "1.39")
```

---
## Code Solution

```python
def series_sum(n):
    newNum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a = 1 / (1 + 3 * i)
        newNum += a
    return f'{newNum:.2f}'
```
