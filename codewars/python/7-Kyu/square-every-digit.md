# Square Every Digit

---
## Info

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

**Note:** The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!

## Code

Solution

```python
def square_digits(num):
    # Your code here
```

Sample Tests

```python
import codewars_test as test
from solution import square_digits

@test.describe("Premade tests: ")
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
    def basic_test_cases():
        test.assert_equals(square_digits(9119), 811181)
        test.assert_equals(square_digits(0), 0)
```

---
## Code Solution

```python
def square_digits(num):
    result = ''
    for digit in str(num):
        result += str(int(digit) ** 2)
    return int(result)
```
